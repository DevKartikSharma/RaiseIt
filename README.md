# ☕ RaiseIt

**Crowdfunding Platform to "Buy a Chai" for Those in Need**

*Empowering small contributions for big impact — one cup of chai at a time.*

RaiseIt is a community-driven crowdfunding platform built with Next.js, React, and MongoDB. It helps users support people in need by donating small amounts, symbolized as buying a cup of tea ("Chai"). Inspired by the power of collective micro-donations, RaiseIt connects donors with individuals (supportees) who share their stories and seek help.
